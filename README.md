# ChunkyAnimationAutomation

Automate animated renders using Python 3.7

Latest Update
---

* Added a GUI, and file renaming for easier importing into animation programs
* Imported the rotation script instead of spawning a new process

---

The `ChunkyLauncher.jar` needs to be placed in the same folder as these scripts.
